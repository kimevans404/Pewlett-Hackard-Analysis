# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. It is expected that a significant number of employees will be retiring soon, but that a mentorship program may be implemented for a smoother transition.

## Results

- The retiring staff will impact multiple departments, with the largest number coming out of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, shown below.

- The number of staff members who are eligible for mentorship will not cover the retiring staff (shown below), but can help lessen the impact and ensure processes remain consistent with the transition.
- it is also important to note that some of the departments with staff eligible for mentorship overlap the departments affected by high retirement numbers.
- the impact of the retirees could be greatly reduced if the age eligibility window was increased.

## Summary

If a complete replacement is expected, 72,458 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. There are 1,549 employees available for mentorship with the current eligibility standards, so there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. All that said, there qualifications would need to be adjusted to lessen the impact of those leaving. Increasing eligibility by an additional 2 years increases the number eligible to 38,401, shown below.
